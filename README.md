# Tuliweb - Informational Wedding Website

Tuliweb is an informational website designed for wedding guests. It provides all essential details about the wedding, including event information, schedule, shared memories, and a confirmation form for attendance. The website features a responsive design, a mobile-friendly burger menu, and an interactive image slider.

- **Image Slider:**  
  The "Naše společné zážitky" section includes an image slider with "next" and "previous" buttons to cycle through photos.

- **Informational Sections:**  
  The website is divided into several sections:
  - **Úvod:** Introduction with images.
  - **Informace:** Details on the event’s date and location.
  - **Program:** The wedding schedule.
  - **My:** A gallery of shared memories.
  - **Potvrzení účasti:** A section to confirm attendance that redirects to a Google Forms link.
